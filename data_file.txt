Parameter values you may need:

Cam Materia : 100Cr6
Shim material : 16 MnCr5
Lubricant : Engine oil SAE-40 (Castrol 40 CF)
Cam young modulus = 209e9 Pa
Tappet/shim young modulus = 216e9 Pa
Poison ratio for both = 0.3
Dynamic Viscosity at 90°C = 0.01381 Pa.s
Density at 90°C = 858.44 kg/m^3
Pressure viscosity coefficient at 90°C= 15e-9 Pa^-1
Boundary shear strength coefficient = 0.12
Combined RMS roughness = 0.2 micrometers
Contact length = 7.2e-3 m

Roughness parameters:
combined RMS = sigma = 0.2e-6 m
Average asperity tip radius = beta_a = 2e-4 average summit radius =  k = 2e-4 
Asperity distribution per unit area = eta_R = 1.25e9


Note: if you require other then above values do deep research from published literature and get most suitable value for my lubricant and solid materials.
