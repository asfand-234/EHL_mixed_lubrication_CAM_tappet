Read python code in text file "mixed_lubrication.txt" which solve reynolds equation by importing "slippy" library.

Your task is to 

1) read and analyze all the files in all sub folders in main folder "slippy" in my respository. 
2) then whatever the functions, classes, variables and modules etc. required to solve the mixed_lubrication code, just find in slippy folder and combine it into a single ready to paste Google colab code which "Do Not" require "slippy" package/library and all the functions/classes etc must be defined within the script. 
**DO NOT simplify any script. You must have to use every defined code and implement it in your combined code**
I give you an example, like, mixed_lubrication required "unified_reynolds_solver" so you will find the file script "unified_reynolds_solver.py" and paste and implement its script so that i can run within code. Then whatever classes/functions/variables etc required by this "unified_reynolds_solver", then just find it in any sub folder and take its script and so on but do not simplify anything. Also read from standard mixed lubrication line contact theory. Until you get a complete single detailed script which is independet of slippy library and run without error and plot non-dimensional reynolds pressure vs x axis and non-dimensional film thickness vs x axis in 1D setup for mixed lubrication line contact theory.
**It must be for line contact only***
Once compelte script generated then must run the entire script and visualize the results by yourself if any error occur then imrpove it.
