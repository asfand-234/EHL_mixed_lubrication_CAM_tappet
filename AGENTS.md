I have attached a data file. In which first two columns S and F are input variables and Third column E is output. 
Your task is to first perform some iterations deeply and generate an vest analytical formula using mathematical functions exp, log, power of integers/fractions, sqrt, sine/cose etc that best suitable for it with some constants (try to keep less than 5). 

Then generate a detailed advanced error free MATLAB code that load same data file and having the equation you first guess and perform advance iterations to predict best values of all constants such that the accuracy of every predicted value E must remain above 80% with respect to original E value. 


But before generating MATLAB code, you must have to perform many mathematical treatments by hit and trial and perfrom many iterations so that you must 100% get sure that finding optimum values of these constants would must give every E values 80%+ accurate.
