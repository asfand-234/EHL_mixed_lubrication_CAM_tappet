Read the text file "symbolic_data.txt". It is data having first two columns are  independent variables (S, F).
And third column is dependent variable (E).

I want to get a perfect analytical formula for E but the issue is E trend is very irregular. 

Your task is to first split the E data into y1, y2, y3 and if required y4 (not more than y4). In such a way that the product of y1*y2*y3*y4 must be equal to E. 
First using initial guesses and without any treatment just split E into Y columns. 
Then visualize and analyze the trend of each vs with either S or F or both (whatever more suitable) and using any mathematical functions like ex0, log, sqrt, power of integers/fractions, cose/sin, hyperbolic functions etc. etc. And fit an analytical formula for each Y. 

After fitting suitable formulas calculated predicted Y. Every value of The predicted Y must be 90% accurate with respect to your original Y value of each formula. 
If error is greater then move back to step 1 and manually tune different values in each y1, y2, y3 or y4 whever suitable. Keep adjusting values until all the y functions get a suitable trend shape. But during adjusting Y values this make sure their product must be equal to 100% E value.
Once all Y gets proper trends and for all Y you get a suitable analytical formula and all predicted Y values are 90% above accurate then provide me only all Y original data and Y formulas.
