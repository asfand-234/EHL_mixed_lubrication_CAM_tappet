Read python code in text file "python_slippy.txt". 

Your task is to run the code and see what erros comes then fix the error and re run until the solution converge successfully.
The code must only two 1D plots seperately. 1) Non-dimensional pressure (from reynolds solution only mot hertzian pressure) vs non-dimensional length X
 2) Non-dimensional fikm thickness vs non dimensional length X
3) saves two data files for both graphs.

Do not make any other changes except what is required for smooth  convergece.
And generate only complete ready to paste google colab script without missing any line.
