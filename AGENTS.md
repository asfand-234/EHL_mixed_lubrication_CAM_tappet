Read Python code in text file "ehl_python.txt" which is related to friction torque reduction due to surface texture using 1D Mixed lubrication Line contact having  in CAM and tappet mechanism.
And cam lift data "updated_lift.txt"

FOR THIS TASK YOU HAVE NO TIME LIMIT. TAKE AS MUCH TIME YOU NEED TO ACHIEVE THE BELOW TARGET.

PROBLEM:
Due to some issue or bug there are unrealistic greater %average friction increment results are generated at espeicially at high rpms 700 and 900 for all texture area densities.

TASK:
1) Run the code and print % average friction torque reduction with respect to untextured for rpms 700 and 900 and for all three texture area densities at 90°C. And analyze the ambigous unrealsitc large increase of friction due to texture.
2) Deep analyze the entire code and find the real cause/bug and fix it
3) re-run and print if friction reduction is under range about <15% then run the code for 110°C and analyze the results. 
4) if the results are realistic then generate fomplete updated  ready to paste script without missing any line.

HARD STRICT RULE:
1) Do not change texture parameters vaues. They are fixed.
2) Do not change Kinematics formulas.
