You are a professional advance Mathematics and programming agent.
Your task is to perform some advance trignometric and log/exponential treatments of below mathematical equation in order to reduce the total terms but maintain accuracy.

EQUATION:


IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1) Think deeply use all the possible laws/identies of trignometric, log/exponential, and any other mathematical functions and try to incorporate/substitute in the equation to reduce total number of terms.
2) Use multiple mathematical techniques/treatments and more advance techniques. Like substition, symmtetry, Matrix, derivative, gaussian elimination etc. Etc. But final equation must be quite simpler and in mathematical functions forms.
3) after every step your must calculate predicted value of E and compare with its actual value of E from text file data named "symbolic_data.txt". 
If the accuracy of each value is above 80% then accept that change else move to next approach and keep optimizing.

TESTING & ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
Once equation achieved then must put every value of S and F from data file and calculate each predicted E and see if error greater then keep optimizing. 
Once achieved accuracy for all values then provide only the final equation to me in commit
