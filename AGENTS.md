Run the python code in text file "test6666.txt" and keep eye on convergence. Deeply analyze and find the reason of overflow and invalid values encounter issues arise after step 151/329 onward. 
Fix the issues and re-run entire code. 
2) Criteria:

i) load error must remain < 1%
ii) residual <1e-7
iii) total runtime of cycle <180 seconds

3) if any cam angle step did not pass any above criteria then keep optimize code and keep running and keep monitoring.
