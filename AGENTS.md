Read every paragrpah, figures, equations and results of  "reference_article.pdf".  Generate a perfect python code of mixed lubrication solving accurately reynolds equations and frictions. 
Use all models mention in article and generate adcanced code. Take parameter values from text file "data_file" where required, assume any missing value by yourself from relevant literature. 
Target: the target is to get exactly same figures of pressure and film thickness in figure 4 in article. 
Keep testing and perform iteration until your ger perfect profiles and accuracy of all results including, reynolds pressure, film thickness, asperity and hydrodynamic pressure and frictiom torque.
Deliverable: only generate a complete error free google colab executable script which solve all physics in pdf article and must plot,
Hydrodynamic pressure vs x axis, film thickness vs x axis, asperity and hydrodynamic friction vs cam angle and frictiom torque vs cam angle and print averaged frictiom torque for all RPMs.
Do not generate any results to me. Rather you must test and observe everything by yourself. Generate only complete error free perfect complete simulation script. I will generate results by my own.
