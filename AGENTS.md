Read the text file "symbolic_data.txt". It is data having first two columns are  independent variables (S and F).
And third column is dependent variable (E).

TASK:
Your task is to perform symbolic regression and generate a perfect Mathematical equation that fit the provided data. 

HARD STRICT RULES:
1)Do not perform polynomial fit. Use any other than thab polynomial equation.
2) Use mathematical symbols in model which is more suitable like, exp, log, power etc.
3) Try to not make it very long or very complex.
4) The accuracy must be greater than 94%

TESTING CRITERIA:
Once the symbolic expression created then run with every value of independent data and verify the accuracy must be 94%. If achieved then generate only the final mathematical expression to me.
