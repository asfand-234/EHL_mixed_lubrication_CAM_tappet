Read python code in text file "python_slippy.txt". 

Your task is to run the code and see what erros comes then fix the error related to "FftwConvolutionFunction" permanently so that this error must never appear when the script run on google colab.  
Then run the entire code and see if the convergance false/fail then find the exact issues and fix them all. 
Then re run and analyze the nondimensional pressure data. As per standard EHL/mixed lubrication theory, its maximum value must be equal to 1, if not the find the cause and fix it and non-dimensional film thickness must have a flat region at contact zone (X = -1 to X = 1).
Once above all steps achieved and then final re run the code and make sure its smoothness then generate only complete ready to paste google colab compatible script without missing any line.
