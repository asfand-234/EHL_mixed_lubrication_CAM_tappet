Task 
Read and deeply analyze the python code in text file "test6666.txt". It is study of thermal Transient 1D mixed Lubrication Line contact.

Now your task is to implement pressure flow factor and shear flow factor by Patir and Cheng more perfectly.

First you need to search from web sources and study relevant research artices/journals and find the most concise and appropriate flow factors methamatical forms and explanations. 
Then correctly implement at their position in reynolds equation as per standard theory.

Then print results of pressures and film thickness of Transient thermal mixed lubrication study. 
And also print relevant data to verify what impact has been imposed by these flpw factors. Is it correct as per standard theory??

Make sure no any diturbance occur on reynolds balance and stability.
Make sure of preventing any issues like NaN, invalid values, overflow, and other numerical instability.

Do not implement any non-physical and non-logical clipping, clamps and constraints. All corrections must be pure physics base.
