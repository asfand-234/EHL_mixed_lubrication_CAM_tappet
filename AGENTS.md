Read the text file "symbolic_data.txt". It is data having first two columns are  independent variables (S, F).
And third column is dependent variable (E).

TASK:
Your task is to create a fitted polynomial equation that gives upto 85% accurcay. 
Try to make less order polynomial by using support of other mathematical functions like exp, log, powers, sin/cos wherever helpful.

HARD STRICT RULES:

1)  Prioritize interpretability and simplicity but maintain perfect accuracy.
2) The accuracy must be upto 85%

TESTING CRITERIA:
Once fitted equation achieved then put each value of S and F and calculate E and compare it with original each data of E if error is greater then optimize the polynomial equation to highest extend. Once accuracy achieved then generate only the optimized fitted equation for me in commit.
