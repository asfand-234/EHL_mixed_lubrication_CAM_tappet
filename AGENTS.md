Read python code in text file "python_slippy.txt" which is related to complete mixed lubrication/EHL solution of reynolds equation.

TASK:
Your task is to:
1) Run the entire script and find the errors and fix them all. 
2) Once the code converged successfully then analyze the entire code deeply line by line.
3) Make sure the script must plot non-dimensional reynolds pressure vs X axis, and Non-dimensional film thickness vs X axis.
3) if then analyze both the profiles and their data. Their profile must meet fhe standard mixed lubrication/EHL Line contact reynolds (dome like or hertzian shape) and film thickness profiles.
4) If solution smoothly converge and both profiles are 100% correct and remove unnecessary code lines, comments and any extra lines which are not the part of "QD mixed lubrication (hydrodynamic + asprity (roughness) loads ) Line contact theory.

5) Then finally generate complete ready to paste google colab script. Do not show me changes/diff. Just provide me complete final updated code without hidden (@@) lines.
