Read Python code in text file "ehl_python.txt" which is related to 1D Mixed lubrication Line contact having compressible reynolds equation solution in CAM and tappet mechanism.
And cam lift data "updated_lift.txt"

PROBLEM: The code taking too long time to run and display results of hydrodynamic friction and asperity friction.

TASK:
1) Run the entire code for plotting hydrodynamic friction Fh and asperity friction Fb at 300 RPM for untextured case and analyze and noticed the initial computational time.
2) Find the exact causes/bugs/inconsistencies throughout the code which is yielding greater run rime. And fix them all.
3) Re-run the entire script and analyze computational time. If reduced at least 4 times lower the previous then acceptable, else re-optimize the script and reduce the run time. 

Keep running entire code and keep analyzing run time and keep optimizing script until at least its reduced 4 times the initial runtime. 



HARD STRICT RULES:
1) Do not change the "KINEMATICS"  formulas in script.
2) Do not oversimplify any physics.
3) Do not add any non-physical or non-logical clipping, conditions or boundness.
4) Make sure the results/resolution/accracy of physics do not get disturbed.
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
You must run the entire code everytime once achieved  reduced runtime then only generate update complete script ready to paste for me without missing any line. Do not provide any results.
