Read the text file "symbolic_data.txt". It is data having first two columns are  independent variables (S, F).
And third column is dependent variable (E).

TASK:

Your task is to create a perfect Gaussian model for E as function of S and F.

TESTING CRITERIA:
1) After every step you must put each values of S and F and calculate predicted E and compare it with original E.
2) Try to make the gaussian model simple and with lest constants. To achieve this you can reduce the accuracy from 100% to 80%. But not below 80% for each value of E.
3) Once target achieved then provide precisely the final model in commit with neccesasy explanations.
